# htgettoken

`htgettoken` gets OIDC bearer access tokens by interacting with a
Hashicorp vault server configured for retrieving and storing OIDC
refresh tokens using the
[htvault-config package](https://github.com/fermitools/htvault-config).

For details on its usage please see the
[man page](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/fermitools/htgettoken/blob/master/htgettoken.html).

Packaging for Red Hat Enterprise Linux systems is included.  Rpms are
distributed in the
[Open Science Grid yum repositories](https://opensciencegrid.org/docs/common/yum/#install-the-osg-repositories).
After enabling the OSG repositories, do this as root to install it:
```
yum install htgettoken
```

Alternatively, it can be installed from
[pypi](https://pypi.org/project/htgettoken/)
with `pip install htgettoken`.

htgettoken and Vault are also integrated with 
[HTCondor](https://htcondor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/admin-manual/file-and-cred-transfer.html#using-vault-as-the-oauth-client).
It is available in HTCondor versions 9.0.6 and later.
